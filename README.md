# AlgoAlly-batch01
This repository is intended for the purpose of adding all the questions and solutions for all the problems covered during the first batch of AlgoAlly starting from January 2024. NOTE:  all branches will be created by individual students and these branches will have to be created from the main branch only.

Instructions : 
1. Take a clone of the repository (only for the first time) -> into your local computer
2. FROM THE MAIN BRANCH ITSELF , create your own personal branch (git checkout -b your-branch-name)
3. Now type (git branch), to chcek the branch you are currently at and ensure you are at (your-branch-name)
4. Now that you have checked that you are in your branch , LETS START THE CLASS

5. Code along with me , in the appropriate sub-directory (based on the topic we are doing in class)
6. Once we are done , perform the following actions to help me see review your code :
   6.1 git add (your changed files)
   6.2 git commit -m "a valid commit message with your week number or topic name ??? "
   6.3 git push origin (your-branch-name)
   6.4 go to github , create a pull request with your name and week 1 as the title (this will be the PR that will track your entire coding journey !!!!)


YOUR SECOND CLASS ONWARDS : 
1. take the new set of challenges onto your local :
   1.1 git checkout main
   1.2 git pull
   1.3 git checkout your-branch-name
   1.4 git merge main
